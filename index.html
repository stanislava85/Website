 <h1>Background :(</h1>
    <p>I am a 33-year-old mother who is internationally educated and has a degree in Marketing Management. I moved to USA about 10 years 
  ago and I have worked in the event planning and hospitality field for a few years.
  I have been a volunteer with NYLAG since 2015 and mostly a stay-home mom since then. While I have been caring for my son and volunteering I have 
  also been fullfilling some administrative duties for a construction company, part-time and remotely for the most part. I 
  have always been keen on Technology and looking for the right opportunity to set foot in this industry. And finally, this time has come!

 <h1>Now --> MotherCoders :)</h1>
 
    <p>  I have been craving to learn something new and dive into this exciting and ever-evolving field of Technology and figured out that right now is the best time to do it 
        because my son has just started attending school and I have more spare time. So, I came across MotherCoders' upcoming class info in NYC and immediatelly felt
        like this was meant to be. After filling the application and going throught 2 rounds of interviews, luckily they have chosen me to be one of the mothers in their 2019 NYC Spring Cohort.
      I am very excited and honored to be part of The MotherCodersâ€™ community and believe the
      program will give me a very solid base of knowledge and valuable networking and experience, which I
      need in order to begin my journey as a Woman in Tech. I am grateful that organizations like MotherCoders, Women NYC and 
      Google are working on closing the gap by helping women and mothers
      advance their careers in a field where they are still very underrepresented.</p>

      <div class="content">
  <h1>What's next...?</h1>
      <p> My career goal is to transition into the Tech field and land a position as a Software Quality Assurance Analyst. However,
          in order to achieve that I will need to attend some more classes and learn the QA frameworks and languages that go together. Currently, I am
      researching which one would be most suitable, convenient and prolific for my plans, goals and lifestyle. Ideally, I will attend one of these
  classes in the summer and start applying for jobs around the begining of this fall, 2019. Wish me Luck!!!</p>
